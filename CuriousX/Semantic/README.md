## Semantic Analysis
The semantic analysis phase in the CuriousX compiler is responsible for detecting and reporting semantic errors in the code, such as type mismatches, undeclared variables, and invalid operations. It builds upon the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generated by the parser to perform type checking and inference.

## Key Components

### 1. Semantic Analyzer (`Semantic.hpp`, `Semantic.cpp`)
- Traverses the AST to perform semantic checks
- Handles type inference and type checking
- Manages variable declarations and usage

### 2. Scoped Symbol Table (`SymbolTable.hpp`)
- Maintains a hierarchical structure of symbol tables for different scopes
- Stores information about variables, including their names, types, and scope levels
- Supports nested scopes 

### 3. Type System (`SymbolTable.hpp`)

```cpp
enum class InferredType
{
    INTEGER,
    FLOAT,
    STRING,
    BOOL
};

struct SymbolInfo
{
    InferredType type;
    LexerToken token;
};
```

## Functionality

1. **AST Traversal**: The semantic analyzer traverses the AST generated by 
the syntax analysis.
2. **Symbol Table Management**: As it traverses the tree, it populates the symbol table with 
variable declarations.
3. **Type Inference**: Performs type inference on expressions, determining the types of variables and 
expressions based on their usage and context.
4. **Error Detection**: Identifies and reports semantic errors, including:
   - Type mismatches in operations
   - Undeclared variable usage
   - Invalid operations (e.g., performing arithmetic on non-numeric types)
5. **AST Annotation**: The original AST is annotated with inferred type information.

## Type Inference
- Supports basic types: INTEGER, FLOAT, STRING, and BOOL
- Infers types based on literal values, operations, and variable declarations
- Ensures type consistency in expressions and assignments

## Output
The output of the semantic analysis is an annotated AST where:
- All variables are associated with their inferred types
- Expressions are typed
- Semantic errors have been detected and reported

Example of an annotated AST:
```
                         =
                        / \
             (INTEGER) x   +
                          / \
                         5   *
                            / \
                           2   3
```

## Limitations and Future Work
- Division by zero checking is planned but not yet implemented
- if statement cannot start a program
