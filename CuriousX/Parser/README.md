## Syntax Analysis
The syntax analyzer takes tokens from the lexer as input, checks if the sequence 
of tokens generated by the lexer is a valid program according to the language's grammar,
 and outputs a parse tree.

Grammar rules in natural language:

- A program consists of one or more statements.
- Statements can be expressions, print statements, or conditional statements.
- Expressions can consist of operands (such as numbers or variables) and operators (such as +, -, *, /).
- Parentheses can be used to group sub-expressions and indicate precedence.
- Operators have a specific order of precedence (such as multiplication and division before addition and subtraction).
- Operators with the same precedence have a specific associativity (such as left-to-right or right-to-left).
- Print statements output the value of an expression.
- Conditional statements (if-else) allow for branching based on a condition.

In a formal notation:

```pwsh
<program> ::= <statement> { <statement> }

<statement> ::= <expr>
              | <print_stmt>
              | <if_stmt>

<print_stmt> ::= 'print' <expr>

<if_stmt> ::= 'if' '(' <expr> ')' <block> [ 'else' <block> ]

<block> ::= '{' <statement> { <statement> } '}'
          | <statement>

<expr> ::= <term> { <addop> <term> }

<term> ::= <factor> { <mulop> <factor> }

<factor> ::= '(' <expr> ')'
           | <number>
           | <identifier>
           | <bool_literal>

<addop> ::= '+' | '-'

<mulop> ::= '*' | '/'

<bool_literal> ::= 'true' | 'false'

<number> ::= <digit> { <digit> }

<identifier> ::= <letter> { <letter> | <digit> }

<digit> ::= '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9'

<letter> ::= 'a' | 'b' | ... | 'z' | 'A' | 'B' | ... | 'Z'
```

In summary:

- A program is a sequence of statements.
- A statement can be an expression, a print statement, or an if statement.
- An expression is made up of terms combined with addition or subtraction.
- A term is a product of factors.
- A factor is a number, an identifier, a boolean literal, or a parenthesized sub-expression.
- A print statement outputs the value of an expression.
- An if statement allows conditional execution based on an expression, with an optional
 else clause.
- A block can be a single statement or multiple statements enclosed in curly braces.
The `Node.hpp` file contains utility function for the tree nodes

```c++
// Node structure
enum class NodeType
{
    BinaryOperation,
    ConditionalOperation,
    BlockOperation,
};

class ASTNode
{
  public:
    ASTNode(const LexerToken& token) : token(token) {}
    virtual ~ASTNode() = default;
    virtual NodeType getType() const = 0;
    LexerToken token;
};
```
For example, consider the following expression in our CuriousX:

```c
x = 5 + 2 * 3
```

The parse tree for this expression would have the following structure:
```sh
                         =
                        / \
                       x   +
                          / \
                         5   *
                            / \
                           2   3

```
