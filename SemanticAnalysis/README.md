Type mismatches: If the compiler encounters an expression where an integer is being used with a float, or where a variable of one type is being used with a variable of another type, it can detect this as a type mismatch error.

Division by zero: If the compiler encounters an expression where a division operation is being performed with a zero denominator, it can detect this as a division by zero error.

Undeclared variables: If the compiler encounters a variable that has not been previously declared, it can detect this as an undeclared variable error.

not explicitly typed

add constexpr where necessary


1. traverse tree 
2. check and add variables to list 
3. type inference.
