## Syntax Analysis

The syntax analyzer takes tokens from the lexer as input, it checks if the sequence of tokens generated by the lexer is a valid program according to the language's grammar and outputs a parse tree 

Grammar rules in natural language :

-   Expressions can consist of operands (such as numbers or variables) and operators (such as +, -, *, /).
-   Parentheses can be used to group sub-expressions and indicate precedence.
-   Operators have a specific order of precedence (such as multiplication and division before addition and subtraction).
-   Operators with the same precedence have a specific associativity (such as left-to-right or right-to-left).

In a formal notation

```c++
<expr> ::= <term> {<addop> <term>}

<term> ::= <factor> {<mulop> <factor>}

<factor> ::= '(' <expr> ')' | <number> | <identifier>

<addop> ::= '+' | '-'

<mulop> ::= '*' | '/'
```

In summary 

-   Expression is made up of sum of terms
-   Term is a product of factors
-   Factor is a number or parenthesized sub expression

The `Node.hpp` file contains utility function for the tree nodes

```c++
// Node structure
struct Node
{
  std::shared_ptr<Node> left;
  std::shared_ptr<Node> right;
  LexerToken type;
};
```
For example, consider the following expression in our CuriousX:

```c
x = 5 + 2 * 3
```

The parse tree for this expression would have the following structure:
```sh
                         =
                        / \
                       x   +
                          / \
                         5   *
                            / \
                           2   3

```
